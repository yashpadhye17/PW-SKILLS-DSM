    "The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values suggesting that the regression line fits the data better. An R-squared value of one implies that the independent variable(s) explain all of the variance in the dependent variable, whereas a value of zero shows that the independent variable(s) do not explain any variation in the dependent variable.\n",

    "When the number of independent variables in the model is big or there are numerous possible independent variables to pick from, adjusted R-squared is very beneficial. In such instances, the conventional R-squared may offer a deceptive measure of the model's goodness of fit, since it tends to grow when additional independent variables are included, even if these variables do not materially enhance the model fit.\n",

    "Consider a regression model with ten independent variables, only three of which are significant predictors of the dependent variable. Because of the enormous number of independent variables, the conventional R-squared would be rather high in this scenario, even if the majority of them do not contribute much to model fit. The adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, would be smaller, reflecting the fact that just a few independent factors are significant predictors of the dependent variable.\n",

    "Lasso regularisation (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a technique used in linear regression to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalisation performance. Lasso regression augments the loss function with a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. Because of this penalty term, some of the coefficients are forced to be set to zero, resulting in a sparse model that chooses just the most relevant characteristics.\n",

This penalty term makes the coefficients modest but does not make any of them zero.

If we have a dataset with 1000 samples and 100 attributes, and we want to forecast the price of a property based on its features using linear regression.

As a result, a model that performs well on training data may perform badly on fresh, unknown data.\n",

For example, Lasso regression may be used by adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This penalty term pushes the model to choose just the most significant characteristics while setting the weights of the less important elements to zero. As a result, the model is simpler and more interpretable, and it is less prone to overfit the data.\n",

    "In reality, we may modify the penalty term's severity by adjusting a hyperparameter known as the regularisation parameter. A smaller regularisation parameter value results in less regularisation and a more complicated model, whereas a greater value results in more regularisation and a simpler model. Cross-validation may be used to find the best value for the regularisation parameter.\n",
