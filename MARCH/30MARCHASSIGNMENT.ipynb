    "Elastic Net Regression is a statistical regression approach that combines Lasso and Ridge regression features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression is a technique that utilises a penalty term to set some regression coefficients to zero, which aids in variable selection and improves model interpretability. When there are associated factors, Lasso regression might become unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression, on the other hand, is a strategy that utilises a penalty term to decrease the regression coefficients, which can aid in decreasing overfitting and boosting prediction accuracy. Ridge regression, on the other hand, does not undertake variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing a new penalty term that is a weighted sum of the L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties, Elastic Net Regression combines the benefits of both Lasso and Ridge regression. Elastic Net Regression can now do variable selection as well as regularisation, making it suitable for high-dimensional data with associated predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise, Elastic Net Regression differs from previous regression approaches in that it combines the qualities of Lasso and Ridge regression, allowing for variable selection as well as regularisation."

    "\n",
    "3. Use a cross-validation approach, such as k-fold cross-validation, to assess the model's performance. The training set is divided into k folds, the model is fitted on k-1 folds, and the model is evaluated on the remaining fold. Repeat for each fold and average the results to get an approximation of the model's performance.\n",

The regression coefficients, in particular, describe the change in the response variable for a unit change in the predictor variable while maintaining all other predictor variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, because Elastic Net Regression employs a combination of L1 and L2 penalties, the coefficient interpretation can be more complicated. Because of the L1 penalty, some of the coefficients may be set to absolutely zero, indicating that the associated predictor variable is unimportant in predicting the response variable. The L2 penalty can lessen the influence of noisy or irrelevant predictors by shrinking the coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression coefficient size and sign can give insight into the relative relevance of each predictor variable in predicting the response variable. Positive coefficients imply that increasing the predictor variable increases the response variable, whereas negative coefficients indicate that increasing the predictor variable decreases the response variable.\n",

The selection of these parameters can have a substantial influence on the size and sign of the coefficients, as well as the model's interpretation."

Employ an Elastic Net Regression variation that can accommodate missing values: Elastic Net Regression variations that can handle missing values directly include Iterative Elastic Net Regression and Modified Elastic Net Regression. These approaches can impute missing values within the algorithm, which may outperform imputation outside the algorithm.\n",

    "4. Another technique is to consider missing data as a different category and construct a missing indication variable. This, along with the other variables, can be included as a predictor in the model. This strategy, however, can lead to greater complexity and may necessitate extra regularisation."
