    "Grid search is a machine learning approach for determining the optimum hyperparameters for a model. Hyperparameters are values that are determined before to training and are not learnt from data. The learning rate, regularisation strength, number of hidden layers, and number of neurons in a neural network are all examples of hyperparameters.\n",

    "Grid search is a machine learning method for finding the best hyperparameters for a model. Hyperparameters are values that are chosen before to training and are not learned from data. Hyperparameters include the learning rate, regularisation strength, number of hidden layers, and number of neurons in a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is then trained and tested on every hyperparameter combination in the grid. Depending on the individual problem and the model's purpose, the evaluation metric used to assess the performance of different hyperparameter combinations may differ. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean squared error, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve are all common assessment criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating all hyperparameter combinations, the combination with the best performance is chosen as the optimum set of hyperparameters. This collection of hyperparameters is then used to train a final model on the complete training set, and the model is assessed on a separate test set to estimate its performance on fresh, previously unknown data.\n",

    "Overall, grid search is an effective strategy for determining the optimum hyperparameters for a machine learning model and can aid in model performance improvement. It can, however, be computationally expensive and time-consuming, particularly for models with numerous hyperparameters or huge datasets."

    "Grid search CV and randomised search CV are two strategies used in machine learning for hyperparameter tuning. They differ, however, in how they explore the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid lookup CV is a way of methodically investigating a range of hyperparameter values by building a grid of all possible hyperparameter combinations and using cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on each combination. Grid search is an exhaustive search strategy, which means it searches over all potential hyperparameter combinations in the grid. While this strategy has the potential to be useful, it may also be computationally costly, particularly when the hyperparameter space is huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized search CV, on the other hand, is a strategy that searches the hyperparameter space at random rather than exhaustively. It works by setting a range of feasible values for each hyperparameter and then randomly picking hyperparameter combinations from these ranges. Randomized search, like grid search, uses cross-validation to assess the model's performance on each hyperparameter combination. Since it does not have to assess every conceivable combination of hyperparameters, randomised search is less computationally expensive than grid search, especially when the hyperparameter space is huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision between grid search and randomised search is determined by the individual task and available processing resources. When the hyperparameter space is limited and the resources to do an exhaustive search are available, grid search is a suitable alternative. Randomized search, on the other hand, can be more computationally economical while still attaining high performance when the hyperparameter space is huge or computing resources are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, grid search CV and randomised search CV are both viable strategies for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning, and the decision between them is dependent on the individual issue and computing resources available. While exhaustive search is possible, grid search is best suited for very small hyperparameter spaces, whereas"

    "Data leaking is an issue in machine learning when information from outside the training data is included in the model accidentally. When evaluated on new, unknown data, this might lead to an overestimation of the model's performance, making it look more accurate than it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model is trained on data that contains information that would not be available at the time of prediction, data leakage occurs. This can occur in a variety of ways, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Target leakage occurs when the target variable, which is the variable being predicted by the model, is mistakenly included in the input characteristics required to train the model. In a credit scoring model, for example, if the target variable is whether or not a person defaulted on a loan, adding the loan repayment status in the input characteristics would be a sort of target leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Train-test contamination occurs when information from the test data is leaked into the training data. For example, if the test data is used to identify outliers or missing values and this information is used to preprocess the training data, the model will have information about the test data that it would not have in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Time leaking is the use of knowledge from the future to make predictions about the past. For example, if a model is trained to forecast stock prices and it incorporates knowledge about future prices that was not accessible at the time of prediction, this is a type of time leakage.\n",

    "* Example:\n",
    "Assume a dataset is used to forecast whether or not a client would churn. The customer's account balance is one of the input features. If the information was obtained from a bank and included the amount up to the moment of client turnover, this would be a sort of target leakage. In this situation, the model would use information that was not accessible at the time of prediction, resulting in overfitting and poor performance on fresh, previously unknown data. To avoid this, the balance should be eliminated from the dataset or replaced with one that is only known up to the moment of prediction."

    "Data leaking is a prevalent issue in machine learning that can lead to model overestimation and poor generalisation. It is critical to take the following procedures to avoid data leaks while developing a machine learning model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the problem and the data: It is critical to comprehend the problem at hand as well as the data needed to train and test the model. This comprises determining the target variable, the input characteristics, and any potential data leakage sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Separate the training and testing data: The training data should only be used to train the model, while the testing data should only be used to evaluate its performance. The testing data should not be utilised for preprocessing or feature selection because this might result in train-test contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Employ cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating the performance of a model by repeatedly partitioning the data into training and testing sets. This ensures that the model is not overfitting to a specific subset of the data and that the assessment represents the model's genuine performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use caution while picking features: Feature selection approaches such as selecting the most significant characteristics or deleting linked features might be effective for enhancing model performance. These strategies, however, should be utilised with caution since they can add sources of leakage. Just the training data should be used for feature selection, and the same features should be used for all cross-validation folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Carefully prepare the data: If they are dependent on information from the testing data, preprocessing activities such as imputing missing values or scaling the data might add sources of leakage. Preprocessing should be done solely on training data and should be done consistently across all cross-validation folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. For time series data, use time series cross-validation: Time series data should be treated with caution since time leaking can occur when knowledge from the future is used to anticipate the past. Time series cross-validation, which divides the data into successive time periods, can assist to avoid this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise, avoiding data leaking in machine learning requires rigorous preprocessing, feature selection, and cross-validation, as well as a thorough grasp of the issue at hand and the data at hand. Following these procedures will allow you to create models that generalise effectively to new, previously unknown data."
