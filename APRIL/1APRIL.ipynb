    "Linear regression is used to model the connection between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. It is assumed that the variables have a linear connection and that the dependent variable may be predicted as a continuous function of the independent variables. Linear regression is frequently used to forecast numerical values, such as the price of a property based on its size, location, and other characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, logistic regression is used to describe the connection between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is assumed that the connection between the variables is non-linear and that the dependent variable may be predicted using a logistic function as a function of the independent variables. Logistic regression is frequently used to predict binary outcomes, such as whether or not a client would churn based on their purchasing history and demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For predicting the likelihood of an occurrence or the likelihood of a certain result, logistic regression is more suited. In medical research, for example, logistic regression may be used to forecast the chance of a patient developing a specific disease based on age, gender, and other pertinent parameters. Another application of logistic regression is in marketing, where it may be used to forecast the likelihood of a consumer purchasing a product based on their prior purchase history, demographic information, and other pertinent characteristics. The result is binary in both situations, therefore logistic regression is better suited to modelling this sort of data."

    "In a logistic regression model, feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of the available features (also known as independent variables or predictors) that are most useful for predicting the target variable. Feature selection is critical because it may increase model performance, minimise overfitting, and reduce model computing complexity.\n",

    "1. Univariate feature selection analyses each feature individually and chooses the top k features depending on some statistical measure, such as the p-value or F-score. This approach is simple to develop and computationally efficient, but it may overlook significant relationships between characteristics.\n",

    "2. Recursive feature elimination: This strategy iteratively removes the model's least important features, re-evaluating the model's performance at each stage. This method is computationally intensive, yet it can uncover significant relationships between characteristics.\n",

    "3. Regularization: As previously noted, L1 regularisation (Lasso) and L2 regularisation (Ridge) can be used to penalise the magnitude of the feature coefficients. Some of the coefficients may become zero as a result, essentially picking only the most significant traits. This method may be used for feature selection as well as regularisation.\n",
