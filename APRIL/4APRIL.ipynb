    "A prominent machine learning approach for classification tasks is the decision tree classifier algorithm. It is built on a decision tree, which is a tree-like model in which each node represents a decision or test on an input variable and each branch reflects the decision or test's conclusion.\n",

    "The decision tree classifier algorithm partitions the input data recursively into subsets based on the values of the input characteristics until a stopping requirement is reached. A pre-defined maximum depth of the tree, a minimum number of instances in a leaf node, or a minimum drop in impurity following a split can be used as the halting condition.\n",

    "The method chooses the feature that optimally separates the data at each node depending on a criterion such as information gain or Gini impurity. After a split, information gain measures the reduction in entropy (or uncertainty) of the target variable, whereas Gini impurity assesses the likelihood of misclassifying a randomly selected sample from the dataset.\n",

    "The decision tree classification technique is based on the recursive partitioning principle, which divides the input data into subsets based on the values of the input characteristics. The aim is to build a tree-like model that can predict the class label of new instances by traversing the tree from root to leaf, using the majority class label of the examples in the node as the forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical idea underlying the decision tree classification technique is explained in detail below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step is to establish an impurity measure that measures the homogeneity of a group of examples in relation to their class labels. Gini impurity is a popular impurity metric.which is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini impurity = 1 - ∑ (p_i)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "where p_i is the proportion of instances in the set that belong to class i. The Gini impurity ranges from 0 (when all instances belong to the same class) to 0.5 (when the instances are evenly split among all classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choose the best split: Given a collection of instances and a set of candidate features to split on, the next step is to choose the feature that best separates the data according to the impurity measure. This is accomplished by calculating the impurity of the set before and after the split for each candidate feature and picking the feature that results in the greatest drop in impurity. This is referred to as the information gain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recursive partitioning: After determining the optimal split, the data is divided into two groups depending on the selected feature's values. This method is continued for each subset recursively until a stopping requirement is satisfied, such as reaching a pre-defined maximum depth of the tree or a minimum number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Prediction: Once the tree has been constructed, a new instance is categorised by traversing the tree from the root node to the leaf node, with the majority class label of the examples in the node serving as the prediction.\n",

    "A decision tree classifier solves a binary classification issue by constructing a tree-like model that predicts the class label of a new instance based on its input data. The following are the steps for employing a decision tree classifier for binary classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data preparation entails gathering and preprocessing a dataset including a collection of examples, each with a set of input characteristics and a binary class label (0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Train the model: Divide the dataset into two parts: training and validation, then use the training set to train the decision tree classifier. Until a stopping requirement is satisfied, the decision tree classifier algorithm will recursively split the training set into subgroups based on the values of the input features. The method chooses the feature that optimally separates the data at each node depending on a criterion such as information gain or Gini impurity. The programme then utilises the decision tree to generate predictions on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tune the hyperparameters: Depending on the decision tree classifier's halting criterion and impurity measure, there may be hyperparameters that need to be modified to optimise the model's performance. For instance, the greatest tree depth, the smallest number of instances in a leaf node, or the smallest fall in impurity following a split.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once the hyperparameters have been tweaked, assess the decision tree classifier's performance on a different test set from the training and validation sets. To evaluate the quality of the model's predictions, compute metrics like as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use the model: Once trained and evaluated, the model may be used to predict new instances with unknown class labels. Simply traverse the decision tree from root to leaf, and use the majority class label of the instances in the leaf node as the forecast.\n"

    "The geometric rationale underpinning decision tree classification is that the classifier's decision boundaries may be represented in the input feature space as axis-aligned rectangles or hyperplanes. The decision tree technique builds a tree-like model out of the input feature space, partitioning it into a series of rectangles or hyperplanes, each of which corresponds to a leaf node in the tree. The majority class label of the instances at the leaf node is used to forecast the class label of a new instance as it traverses the tree from the root node to the leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some significant principles and insights connected to decision tree classification's geometric intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Splitting on features: At each node of the decision tree, the algorithm chooses the feature that best divides the data into two subsets that are as homogenous in terms of class labels as feasible. Finding an axis-aligned hyperplane that separates the input feature space into two areas corresponds to this. The decision border is perpendicular to the axis of the split feature and parallel to the other axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After determining the optimum split, the algorithm divides the data into two sections and adds two child nodes to the tree. This method is continued for each subset recursively until a stopping requirement is reached, such as reaching a pre-defined maximum depth of the tree or a minimum number of instances at a leaf node. The outcome is a collection of nested rectangles or hyperplanes that determine the classifier's decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overfitting and pruning: Overfitting can occur in a decision tree classifier if the tree is excessively deep or the dataset is noisy. This can lead to a complicated decision boundary that matches the training data well but fails to generalise to fresh data. To avoid overfitting, the decision tree method can employ pruning strategies like reduced error pruning or cost complexity pruning, which eliminate nodes from the tree that do not increase performance on a validation set.\n",

    "1. True positives (TP): the number of events accurately identified as positive (that is, belonging to the positive class).\n",
