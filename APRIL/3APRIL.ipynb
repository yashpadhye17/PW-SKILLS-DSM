    "Precision and recall are two regularly used criteria for assessing classification model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision is defined as the proportion of genuine positives to total anticipated positives. In other words, accuracy is the frequency with which the model accurately predicts positive cases. A high precision indicates that the model produces few false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, on the other hand, is the fraction of genuine positives among all real positives. In other words, recall assesses how well the model detects affirmative cases. A high recall indicates that the model produces few false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further grasp these notions, imagine a binary classification scenario in which we are attempting to predict if an email is spam or not. When the model accurately predicts an email as spam and the email is indeed spam, this is referred to as a true positive (TP). When the model mistakenly predicts an email as spam, but the email is not spam, this is referred to as a false positive (FP). A false negative (FN) arises when the model predicts an email as not spam when it is actually spam. Finally, a true negative (TN) happens when the model properly predicts that an email is not spam and the email is not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "A classification model should ideally have good accuracy and recall. In practise, however, there is frequently a trade-off between accuracy and recall, since boosting one tends to reduce the other. For example, if we set a very high threshold for predicting spam emails (i.e., only forecast an email as spam if we are absolutely certain it is spam), we may obtain high accuracy but poor recall since we may miss some spam emails. In contrast, if we set a very low threshold for predicting spam emails (i.e., forecast an email as spam even if we are not certain it is spam), we may obtain high recall but low accuracy since we would mistakenly categorise many non-spam emails as spam.\n"

It shows the model's ability to detect all positive cases properly.\n",

    "\n",
    "The F1 score, unlike accuracy and recall, is a single score that summarises the model's entire performance. It is a more informative statistic than either precision or recall alone since it offers a single score that takes accuracy and recall into consideration.\n",

    "To assess the effectiveness of classification models, the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve) are often employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ROC curve depicts the trade-off between true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate (1-specificity) for various categorization thresholds. It creates a curve by plotting the genuine positive rate (y-axis) versus the false positive rate (x-axis) for a variety of threshold values. The model's performance improves as the ROC curve approaches the upper left corner of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC, on the other hand, is a numerical assessment of the model's overall performance. It spans from 0 to 1 and indicates the area under the ROC curve. AUC of 1 indicates a perfect model, whereas AUC of 0.5 indicates a random model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they are indifferent to class imbalance and classification threshold, ROC and AUC are important assessment measures for classification models. They offer a visual and quantitative way to assess the model's performance across various degrees of specificity and sensitivity, which can be valuable in situations where one is more significant than the other.\n"

    "1. Understand the problem: Choosing the correct assessment metric requires a thorough understanding of the situation at hand. For example, if the aim is to reduce false negatives, recall is a more important parameter than accuracy.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Calculate the cost of errors: The cost of errors varies according to the application. In medical diagnostics, for example, a false negative may be more expensive than a false positive. In such circumstances, recall is a more pertinent metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Select a measure that corresponds to the business goal: The application's business aim should be linked with the assessment metric. If the aim is to maximise revenue, for example, the assessment score should be based on how effectively the model predicts profitable consumers.\n",

    "Logistic regression is a binary classification technique that predicts the likelihood of an input belonging to one of many classes. It may, however, be utilised to solve multiclass classification issues using two basic strategies: one-vs-rest (OVR) and softmax regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-vs-rest technique involves training a distinct binary logistic regression model for each class versus the other classes. For example, if the target variable has four classes, we would train four logistic regression models. The model with the greatest projected probability is chosen as the final output during prediction. The one-versus-rest technique is straightforward and effective, but it implies that the classes are mutually exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single model is trained with a softmax activation function that generates a probability distribution over all classes in softmax regression. The softmax function takes a weighted sum of the input characteristics and transforms the values into a probability distribution using the exponential function. The class with the greatest projected probability is chosen as the final output during prediction.\n",

One-vs.-rest is simpler to build and performs well with small datasets, but it struggles with unbalanced classes. Softmax regression, on the other hand, is capable of dealing with class imbalance, but it takes more data and can be computationally expensive."
