Sensitivity to Dataset Characteristics: The Silhouette Coefficient can be sensitive to the underlying characteristics of the dataset, such as data distribution, cluster shape, and data density.

Alternative Distance Measures: Experimenting with different distance measures can be beneficial, especially if the dataset has specific characteristics that make Euclidean distance less appropriate.
