    "Multiprocessing is a built-in Python module that allows the system to execute numerous processes at the same time. It will allow programmes to be divided into smaller threads that may operate independently. The operating system may then assign all of these threads or processes to the CPU and have them execute in parallel, enhancing overall performance and efficiency.\n",
